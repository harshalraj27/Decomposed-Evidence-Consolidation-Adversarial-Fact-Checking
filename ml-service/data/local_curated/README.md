This directory contains a medium-sized, hand-curated offline corpus
used for local testing and benchmarking of the retrieval pipeline.

Files are intentionally long (~3,000 words) to stress sentence
splitting, embedding, and FAISS indexing.

The content is synthetic and paraphrased for testing purposes only.
